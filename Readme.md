Project Overview:
Personal Finance Manager is an application that helps users track their income, expenses, and savings goals. Users can categorize their expenses, visualize financial data through charts, and set financial goals. The app also provides reminders for upcoming bills and summaries of monthly spending patterns.

Features:

	User Authentication and Profiles:
		Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
		User data is protected using JWT authentication.
		
	Expense & Income Tracking:
		Users can log their expenses and categorize them (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment).
		Users can also input income sources (e.g., salary, freelance work).
		
	Budget Management:
		Users can set monthly budgets for different categories (e.g., $500 for food).
		Notifications when spending exceeds the budget.
		
	Savings Goals:
		Users can set savings goals (e.g., save $1000 for a vacation).
		Track progress toward each goal.
		Financial Summary and Charts:
		Provide monthly/weekly summaries of income, expenses, and remaining balance.
		Use charts (like pie charts, bar graphs) to visualize spending patterns by category.
		
	Reminders for Bills:
		Users can add upcoming bills (e.g., rent, utilities) and receive reminders before the due date.
		
	Responsive UI:
		Design a mobile-friendly and user-friendly interface using Angular Material or Bootstrap.
	
Tech Stack:
	Backend (Spring Boot):

		RESTful API development with Spring Boot.
		Use Spring Security with JWT for authentication.
		MySQL or PostgreSQL database for storing user data, transactions, budgets, etc.
		Hibernate or JPA for object-relational mapping.
		Docker for containerizing the backend service.
		
	Frontend (Angular):
		Angular for building a responsive web application.
		Angular Material or Bootstrap for UI components.
		Integrate with the Spring Boot API for all CRUD operations (expenses, income, goals).
		Use NgRx for state management (optional).
		Charts can be created using Chart.js or ngx-charts.
		
	Example API Endpoints (Spring Boot):
		POST /api/auth/signup – User Registration.
		POST /api/auth/login – User Login.
		GET /api/expenses – Get list of all expenses.
		POST /api/expenses – Add new expense.
		PUT /api/expenses/{id} – Update an expense.
		DELETE /api/expenses/{id} – Delete an expense.
		GET /api/goals – Get list of savings goals.
		POST /api/goals – Add new savings goal.
		PUT /api/goals/{id} – Update a goal.
		
	Angular Components:
		Login/Register Component: Forms for user authentication.
		Dashboard Component: Display financial summary and charts.
		Expense List Component: List of expenses with filters (by category, date).
		Add/Edit Expense Component: Form for adding or editing expenses.
		Goal Tracker Component: Show savings goals and progress bars.
		Reminder Component: List and set reminders for bills.
		
Extra Features:
	Email Notifications: Use Spring Mail to send notifications/reminders to users about bill deadlines.
	File Upload: Allow users to upload receipts and store them in the backend.
	This project will give you hands-on experience with Spring Boot for backend services, Angular for 
	frontend development, as well as database management, API integration, authentication, and user interface design.
